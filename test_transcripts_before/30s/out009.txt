 I can buy water for much less than $100. Okay, so even though water is essential to life and far more important than money, money is a currency. And so I prefer to have the money because I can just buy the things I need. And that's the same kind of analogy of performance. It has no intrinsic value, but it contributes to things. You can use it to buy things that you can.
