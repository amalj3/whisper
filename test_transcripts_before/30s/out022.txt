 Okay? So we're not going to build little technology that cools that very well. And even if you could solve it for a little bit, the writing was in the wall. We cannot scale clock frequencies anymore. The reason for that is that originally, clock frequency was scaled assuming that the, most of the power was dynamic power, which was going when you switched the circuit. And what happened as we kept reducing that and reducing that is something that used to be in the noise, namely the leakage currents. Okay? Start.
