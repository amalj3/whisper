 because it says I want to get exactly the same result. But you can give it a flag called FastMath, minus F FastMath, which will allow it to do that kind of reordering. If it's not important to you that it be the same as the default ordering. And when you use that, and particularly using architecture native and FastMath, we actually get about double the performance out of vectorization, just having the compiler vectorize it. Okay.
