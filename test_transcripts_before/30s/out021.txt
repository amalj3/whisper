 was because of power density. And this is a slide from Intel from that era, looking at the growth of power density. And what they were projecting was that the junction temperatures of the transistors on the chip, if they just keep scaling the way they had been scaling, would start to approach, first of all, the temperature of a nuclear reactor, then the temperature of a rocket nozzle, and then the sun's surface.
