 And that's for this one. So then if we look at the different other ones, this one, the order IKJ, it turns out you get good spatial locality for both C and B and excellent for A. And if you look at even another one, you don't get nearly as good as the other one. So there's a whole range of things. This one you're doing optimally, badly, and both. And so you can just measure the different ones. And it turns out that.
