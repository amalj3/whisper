 You can, so already we've actually been taking advantage of it, but you can produce a vectorization report by asking that and it'll tell you the system will tell you what kinds of things are being vectorized, which things are being vectorized, which aren't. And we'll talk about how you vectorize things that the compiler doesn't want to vectorize. And in particular, most machines don't support the newest sets of vector instructions. So the compiler uses...
