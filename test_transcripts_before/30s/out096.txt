 and then do an addition. Okay? And so you have eight multiplications of size n over 2 by n over 2 and one addition of n by n matrices and that gives you your answer. But then of course what you're gonna do is solve each of those recursively. Okay? And that's gonna give you essentially the same type of performance. Here's the code. I don't expect that you understand this, but we've written this using in parallel because it turns out you can do four of them in parallel and the silk spawn.
