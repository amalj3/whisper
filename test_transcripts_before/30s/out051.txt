 Like, why is Python so slow and see so fast? Does anybody know? The two platforms in coverage are so it has two services in C program and that basically causes Python 5.3 structing, which takes up the source of the product. OK, that's kind of on the right track. Anybody else have any eyes? Articulate a little bit. Why Python is so slow? Yeah. You write like multiply and add those. Not the only instructions.
