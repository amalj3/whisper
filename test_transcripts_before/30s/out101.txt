 And so when you do that, you can once again look to see what's the best value for the base case, and it turns out in this case, I guess it's 64. We get down to 1.95 seconds. I didn't do the base case of one, because I tried that, and that was the one that gave us terrible performance. Sorry, 32. Oh, yeah, 32 is even better, 1.3. Good. Yeah, so we picked 32. I think I even, or didn't highlight it. OK. I should have highlighted that off.
