 And if I paralyze the J loop, it actually slows down, I think, right? And then if I do both INJ, it's still bad. I just want to do the out loop there. This has to do, it turns out with scheduling overhead. And we'll learn about scheduling overhead and how you predict that and such. So the rule of thumb here is paralyze outer loops rather than inter loops. And so when we do parallel loops, we get an almost 18x speed up on 18 cores.
