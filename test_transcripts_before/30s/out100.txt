 Let's pick a threshold and below that threshold, let's just use a standard good algorithm for that threshold. And if we're above that, we'll do divide and conquer. So what we do is we call a, if we're less than the threshold, we call a base case. And the base case looks very much like just ordinary, it makes it multiply. Okay.
