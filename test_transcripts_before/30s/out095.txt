 OK. OK. But it turns out there's a trick. You can tile for every pyro of two simultaneously by just solving the problem recursively. So the idea is that you do divide and conquer, divide each of the matrices into four submatrices. And then if you look at the calculations you need to do, you have to solve eight subproblems of half the size and then do a...
