 It's doing lots of code, you're like, doing Python objects like integers and the problem block. Yeah, yeah. OK, good. So the big reason why Python is slow and CSO fast is that Python is interpreted. And CS compile directly to machine code. And Java is somewhere in the middle, because Java is compiled to byte code, which is then interpreted, and then just in time compiled into machine.
