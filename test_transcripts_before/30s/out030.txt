 I couldn't have answered if I hadn't taken 6172. And I got five offers. And when I compared those offers, they tended to be 20% to 30% larger than people are just web monkeys.

But I just want to point out that what we're going to learn is going to be interesting from a practical point of view, i.e. your future.
