 that you can use a tool to figure this out. And the tool that we'll be using is called cache grind. And it's one of the valgrind suites of caches. And what it'll do is it'll tell you what the miss rates are for the various pieces of code. And you'll learn how to use that tool and figure out, oh, look at that. We have a high miss rate for some and not for others. So that may be why my code is running slowly. So when you pick the best one of the.
