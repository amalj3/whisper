 OK, Cij stays the same for everything. We get for that excellent spatial locality, because we're just accessing the same location. Every single time it's going to be in cache, it's always going to be there. It's going to be fast to access C. For A, what happens is we go through an linear order and we get good spatial locality, but for B, it's going through columns. And those points are distributed far away in memory. So the processor's going to be bringing in 64.
