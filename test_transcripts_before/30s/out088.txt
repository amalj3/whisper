 three nested loops. You end up with six nested loops. OK? And so you're basically, you know, busting it like this. And there's a tuning parameter, of course, which is, you know, how big do I make my tile size? You know, if it's s by s. What should I do at the least there? Should it be 64? Should it be 128? Should it be, what number should I use there? How do we find the right value of, um, how do we find the right value of s, this tuning parameter? OK?
