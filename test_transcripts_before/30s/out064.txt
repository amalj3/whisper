 There's another order that things could have been laid out. In fact, they are in Fortran, which is called column major order. So it turns out C in Fortran operate in different orders. And it turns out it affects performance, which way it does it. So let's just take a look at the access pattern for order ijk. So what we're doing is once we figure out what i and what j is, we're going to go through and cycle through k. And as we cycle through k,
