 and all of B. Because the first element of C needs the whole first column of B. The second element of C needs the whole second column of B. Once again, don't worry if you don't fully understand this, because right now I'm just ripping through this at high speed. We're going to go into this in much more depth in the class, and there'll be plenty of time to master this stuff. But the main thing to understand is, you're going through all of B. Then I want to compute another row of C. I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to go through one row.
