 is vector instructions conservatively by default. So if for particular, if you're compiling for a particular machine, you can say use that particular machine. And here's some of the vectorization flags. You can say use the AVX instructions. If you have AVX, you can use AVX2. You can use the fuse multiply add vector instructions. You can give a string that tells you the architecture that you're running on on that special things. And you can say, well, use whatever machine I'm currently compiling on.
