 So generally we will turn off hyperthreading, but the performances that you get tends to be correlated with what you get when you are hyperthread. For floating point unit, it is capable of doing eight double precision operations, that 64-bit floating point operations, including a fused multiply add per core per cycle. So that is a vector unit. So basically each of these 18 cores can do eight-
