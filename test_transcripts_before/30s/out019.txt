 64, the memory correspondingly grow, cost approximately the same. And that was, that's the legacy from Moore's Law and the tremendous advances in semiconductor technology. And so until 2004, Moore's Law and the scaling of clock frequency, so-called denard scaling, was essentially a printing press for the currency of performance. Okay, you didn't have to do anything. You just made the hardware go faster. Very, very, uh, and.
