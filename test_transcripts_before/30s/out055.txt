 update the state of the machine, and then you would fetch the next instruction. And you're going through that each time, and that's done in software. Okay? When you have things compiled to machine code, it goes through a similar thing, but it's highly optimized just for the things that machines are done. Okay? And so when you compile, you're able to take advantage of the hardware interpreter of machine instructions, and that's much, much lower overhead than that.
