 The float is 32. So generally people use 60 in who are doing serious linear algebra calculations use 64 bits. But sometimes they can use actually, sometimes they can use less, and then you can get more performance. If you discover you can use fewer bits in your representation. We'll talk about that too. So last thing that we're going to do is you can actually...
