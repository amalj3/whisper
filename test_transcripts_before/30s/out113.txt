 to do things like you can do pre-processing and you can transpose the matrices, which turns out to help and do data alignment and there's a lot of other things and using clever algorithm for the base case. And so you do more performance engineering. You think of how you're doing, you code and then you run, run to test and that's one nice reason to have the cloud because you can do tests in parallel. So it takes you less time to do your tests in terms of yourâ€¦
