 for of the inner loop. So the question is, which parallel version works best? So we can do parallel the i loop. We can parallel the j loop, and we can do i and j together. You can't do k just with a parallel loop and expect to get the right thing. So, and that's this thing. So if you look, wow, what a spread of running times, right? So if I parallelize the just the i loop, it's 3.18 seconds.
