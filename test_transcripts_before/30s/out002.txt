 talking a little bit about why we do performance engineering. And then I'll do a little bit of administration, and then sort of dive into sort of a case study that'll give you a good sense of some of the things that we're gonna do during the term. I put the administration in the middle, because it's like if you don't, from me telling you about the course, you don't wanna do the course, then it's like why should you listen to the administration, right?
