 The impact of that was that performance was no longer free. You couldn't just speed up the hardware. Now if you wanted to use that potential, you had to do parallel programming. And that's not something that anybody in the industry really had done. So today, there are a lot of other things that happened in that intervening time. We got vector units as common parts of our machines. We got GPUs. We got steeper cache hierarchies. We have a computer.
