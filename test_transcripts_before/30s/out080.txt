 of opportunity here. Yeah. We could also do a lot better on our handling of cache misses. Yeah, OK. We can actually manage the cache misses better. So let's go back to hardware caches and let's restructure the computation to reuse data in the cache as much as possible, because cache misses are slow and hits are fast. And try to make the most of the cache by reusing the data that's already there. So let's just take a look. Suppose that we're.
