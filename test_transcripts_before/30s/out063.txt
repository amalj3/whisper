 a deeper level cache or all the way out to main memory, that is much, much slower. And we'll talk about that kind of thing. So what happens in this matrix problem is the matrices are laid out in memory and row major order. That means you take, you know, you have a two-dimensional matrix, it's laid out in the linear order of the addresses of memory by essentially taking row one and then after row one two and after that stick row three and so forth and unfolding.
