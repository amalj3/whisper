 It turns out O2 was a better setting. Okay? This is one of these cases. It doesn't happen all the time. Usually O3 does better than O2, but in this case, O2 actually optimized better than O3, because the optimizations are to some extent heuristic. Okay? And there are also other kinds of optimization. You can have it do a profile guided optimization where you look at what the performance was and feed that back into the code and then the
